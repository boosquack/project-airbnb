# Airbnb Clone

A modern Airbnb-inspired vacation rental platform built with React.

## About

Learn React by building a real-world project. In this project, I delved into the world of React and explored its capabilities, including hooks and state management.

### What I Learned

- **React Hooks** - useState, useEffect, useContext, useCallback, useMemo, and custom hooks
- **State Management** - Global state with Redux Toolkit and local component state
- **Context API** - Authentication and theme management using React Context
- **React Router** - Client-side routing with protected routes
- **Form Handling** - Building forms with React Hook Form and Zod validation
- **Component Patterns** - Reusable UI components, compound components, and composition
- **API Integration** - Data fetching with Axios and React Query
- **Modern Tooling** - Vite, ESLint, Prettier, and Tailwind CSS

## Features

- **User Authentication** - Sign up and sign in with email and password
- **Browse Listings** - Explore vacation rental properties with images and details
- **Search & Filter** - Find properties by location, dates, and number of guests
- **Listing Details** - View comprehensive property information, amenities, and reviews
- **Favorites** - Save your favorite listings for later
- **Dark Mode** - Toggle between light and dark themes
